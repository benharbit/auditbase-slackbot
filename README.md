## Adding to Slack

Follow these steps to set up this bot on your Slack

1. Obtain an Auditbase API key.
2. Deploy this repository to a server.
   Note down the public URL, e.g. `example.herokuapp.com`

3. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1), and create a new App.

4. Define environmental variables listed in .env.example

5. This app comes with a commands `/scans-explorer`, `/scans`, `/scans-upload`

   - **Go to Slash Commands** and create a new command.
   - For the URL, enter your domain, followed by `/slack/events`.
     _E.g.`https://example.herokuapp.com/slack/events`_
   - Add some description and save.

   We'll need permissions to upload files and read and write to slack:

   - Go to _OAuth and Permissions_ in the left menu
   - Required scopes `commands`, `users:read` and `chat:write`.
   - Consider scopes `app_mentions:read`, `im:read`, `im:write`, `mpim:read`, `mpim:write`, `chat:write.public`, `links:write`, `incoming-webhook` (simplifies life and allows you to do basic interaction/conversation)

   We need Slack auth keys to be added. We do this by setting environment
   variables on the server we set up in step 1:

   - `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Found in _Basic Information_ -> _Signing Secret_
   - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Found in _Oauth and Permissions_ -> _Bot User OAuth Access Token_

   For our HTTP webhook receiver, we also want to set the following
   environment variables:

   - `WEBHOOK_TOKEN`: Any string that will work as a token for calling our endpoint.
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_CHANNEL`: The channel (or user) to receive data from webhooks,
     e.g. `#random` or `@myhandle`.

### Run bot locally

Slack needs a public URL to communicate with your bot.
If you have set up a server running the bot, you _can_ skip this
section, and test directly by pushing the code to your server.

Having the bot running locally does however provide quicker feedback,
and is recommended.

#### Set up public URL tunnel (using ngrok)

You can use any method to have your localhost accessable publicly.
One solution is to use [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup):

```
brew install ngrok
```

Authenticate and find your ngrok auth token at [ngrok setup](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup).

```
ngrok authtoken [YOUR-AUTH-TOKEN]
```

Get a public url forwarded to your port:

```
ngrok http 3000
```

#### Change Slack configuration

The public url in front of your localhost will have to used instead of `https://example.herokuapp.com`
in the Slack bot configuration â€“ See [Adding to Slack](#adding-to-slack) above and change to your ngrok url.

#### Set up auth locally

Get auth keys from the section [Adding to Slack](#adding-to-slack),
and set them in the `.env` file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

#### Run bot

```
yarn start
```

Your local bot should now respond from Slack!
